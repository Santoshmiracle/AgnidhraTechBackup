# UI/UX & Code Audit Findings

_Audit date: 2025-10-22_

## Resolved (2025-10-22)
- Added `PaymentSuccessPage` and `PaymentFailedPage` screens and wired imports in `src/App.jsx`, eliminating the router `ReferenceError`.
- Removed the deprecated syllabus toggle from `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`, so the homepage no longer exposes the broken "Explain Topic" CTA.
- Switched `handleNotifyPayment` in `src/pages/EnrollUsPage.jsx` to `import.meta.env` and unified the WhatsApp escalation number to `+91-7331123651` across flows.
- Corrected all footer quick-link slugs in `src/components/Footer.jsx`, restoring navigation to academy and institute pages.
- Safelisted dynamic Tailwind colour utilities in `tailwind.config.js` to keep gradient, text, and shadow palettes intact in production builds.
- Harmonised footer branding copy with the Agnidhra Technologies name.
- Updated all support/contact email references to use `agnidhra.contact@gmail.com` and `agnidhra.trainings@gmail.com` until domain mailboxes are available.

## Outstanding
- None at this time.

## Suggested next steps
1. Run `npm run build` to confirm the Tailwind safelist covers all dynamic variants and that the new payment pages compile cleanly.
2. Verify payment success/failure redirections in the live checkout flow point to the new screens.
3. Spot-check a few footer links and hero cards after build to ensure gradient styles persist.
